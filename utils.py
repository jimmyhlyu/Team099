# new/good opportunity that's been neglected for too long
# alarm for having too many opportunities or core opportunities

# total opportunity value formula:
# f(how much I like them, whether they are a central node,
# how much they may contribute to their specialty * how much weight I am putting on said specialty)

# measure: rate of lead creation; distribution of lead, opportunity and closed; close rate; closed lost rate and closed won rate;
# general efficiency

# track current close friend separately
# closed won != current close friend because a close friend may preexist or they may leave ones life because of unrelated reasons.
